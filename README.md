This module is a set of ISE add-ons and a few themes. It requires PowerShell5.1 or higher.

_As of February 2019 I no longer intend to update or extend this module. VS Code is clearly Microsoft's choice for a scripting tool going forward. The PowerShell ISE isn't going away any time soon, but it is also no longer under active development so I need no point in continuing to develop this module. I will maintain it and address pull requests should members of the community wish to contribute, maintain or extend this module._

Install the module from the PowerShell Gallery.

```powershell
Install-Module ISScriptingGeek
```

Then in your PowerShell_ISE profile script, import the module.

```powershell
Import-Module ISEScriptingGeek
```

This will add the menu short cuts.

## Themes

The themes can be found and imported from the Themes sub-folder of the module.
These are optional and are not connected to the add-ons.

## Add-ons

Once the module is imported, the add-ons will be listed under **ISE Scripting Geek** on the **Add-ons** menu in the ISE.
A number of the add-ons fall into grouped sub-folders:
